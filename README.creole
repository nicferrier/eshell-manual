eshell is great but doesn't have a decent manual.

Someone wrote a manual and added it to the
[[http://emacswiki.org|EmacsWiki]] back in 
[[http://emacswiki.org/emacs/CategoryEshell|2008]].

Now we have packages we can make this available in Emacs for other
people.

That's what this does.

I guess it also serves as an example of how to build info files in
Emacs packages.
